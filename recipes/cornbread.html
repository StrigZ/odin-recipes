    <p>
      My grandmother always made this cornbread dressing for holiday dinners and
      for family gatherings at other times of the year. Use your favorite
      cornbread mix to make a batch of cornbread, and then crumble it for use in
      this family-favorite recipe. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      This dressing recipe comes together quickly with simple ingredients.
      Here's what you'll need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong> Cornbread:</strong> This recipe starts with crumbled cornbread.
        You can buy pre-made cornbread, make it from a mix, or make a
        from-scratch cornbread recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Vegetables:</strong> You'll need diced onions and celery.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Butter:</strong> Butter is used to saute the fresh vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Eggs:</strong> Two eggs add moisture and richness. They also
        act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dressing
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Stock:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade chicken stock for
        more flavor and moisture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Seasonings:</strong> This cornbread dressing is seasoned with
        dried sage, salt, and black pepper. Of course, you can adjust the
        seasonings to taste.
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>

        <p>Sauté the vegetables in butter until soft.</p>
      </li>
