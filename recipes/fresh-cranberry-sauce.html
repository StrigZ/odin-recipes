      Fresh cranberry sauce is a must for your Thanksgiving dinner. This recipe
      is easy to make in just 20 minutes with 3 ingredients: fresh cranberries,
      sugar, and water. Add some grated orange zest before serving for an extra
      boost of flavor.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries (such as Ocean Spray)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add sugar and cook until sugar is
          dissolved, about 5 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>

          Stir cranberries into the saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
          low, and simmer until cranberries have popped and sauce is chunky,
          about 10 minutes or longer for desired consistency. The longer you
          cook it, the less chunky it will be.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Pour sauce into a serving dish or jars and cover until ready to use;
          the pectin in the cranberries will make the cranberry sauce gel as it
          cools.
